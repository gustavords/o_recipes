I'm gonna change the recipes idea and make something a bit funner

2025-05-21
I want to make the index.html a image of me where my mouth is open (fish eye angle) and the menu is inside it. Once They click I want it to close my mouth and make a bite sound

I'd like the recipe pages to have the recipe on the right and the images on the left, centered during scrolling. Multiple images  maybe, changes as the page is scrolled.
